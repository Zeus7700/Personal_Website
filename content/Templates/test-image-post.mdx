# Testing Image Support

This is a test post to demonstrate how images work in the blog posts with rounded corners and hover effects.

## Here's a test image:

![Test Image](images/Test.jpg)
*This is a test image demonstrating the rounded corner styling and caption support in blog posts.*

The image above should display with rounded corners and a subtle shadow.

## Features of the image styling:

- **Rounded corners** (12px border radius)
- **Responsive sizing** (max-width: 100%)
- **Subtle shadows** that adapt to light/dark mode
- **Hover effects** with smooth transitions
- **Proper spacing** with margins above and below

## More content

You can continue writing your blog post content here. The images will automatically be styled with the rounded corners and hover effects defined in the global CSS.

The image system supports various formats:
- JPEG/JPG
- PNG
- GIF
- WebP
- SVG

All images placed in the `content/blog/images/` folder will be automatically served and styled consistently across your blog posts.
