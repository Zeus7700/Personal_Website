**TL;DR:** I’m not a coder, but I built this fast, minimalist site with **Cursor** and **Windsurf**, inspired by [tommytrinh.me](https://tommytrinh.me/) and [deadsimplesites.com](https://deadsimplesites.com/). It runs on **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Markdown** — fast, clean, and easy to update.

## Background

I’ve always wanted a personal website — something clean, fast, and actually *mine*. The problem?

**I’m not a coder.**

Thankfully, with the help of **Cursor** and **Windsurf**, I was able to put this site together without needing to stare at cryptic error messages for days on end. I used these AI-assisted tools to handle the actual coding part while I focused on the look, feel, and structure.

When it came to inspiration, I had two clear guides:

* **[tommytrinh.me](https://tommytrinh.me/)** — the primary inspiration for my site’s aesthetic: modern, minimal, and to the point.
* **[deadsimplesites.com](https://deadsimplesites.com/)** — for broader ideas on keeping things clean and clutter-free.

## My Approach

I wanted this site to feel:

* **Fast** — minimal JavaScript, optimized loading.
* **Readable** — crisp typography, enough breathing room.
* **Responsive** — looks good whether you’re on a phone or a giant monitor.
* **Minimal** — just the essentials, no fluff.

## How It’s Built

Even though I’m not a developer, the tech stack ended up being pretty modern (Thanks ChatGPT):

* **Next.js 14**
* **TypeScript**
* **Tailwind CSS**
* **Markdown/MDX**
* **Vercel**

I wrote my content in Markdown, organized it into folders, and let the site generate pages automatically.

## Features I’m Proud Of

* **Dark/Light Mode**
* **Smooth Navigation**
* **Performance-First**

## What’s Next

* **Projects page**
* **Newsletter signup**
* **Better image optimization**

## Final Thoughts

I thought building a site like this would take forever, not happen almost instantly. Using Cursor and Windsurf to handle the coding side meant I could focus on design choices, structure, and content instead of debugging.
