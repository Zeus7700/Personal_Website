# Hi, I’m Zack

I build things that work — and work well.  
As a **mechanical engineer** and **hands-on problem solver**, I’m driven by the challenge of turning ideas into reality.  

From robotics competitions to professional engineering projects, my goal is simple:  
**Design with purpose. Build with precision. Solve with creativity.**
